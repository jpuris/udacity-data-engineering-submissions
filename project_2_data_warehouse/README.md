# Project 2: Data Warehouse

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and
data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a
directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Project Datasets

Project's source data consists of two datasets that reside in S3.

Here are the S3 links for each:

- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
- Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains
metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's
track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```JSON
{
  "num_songs": 1,
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
  "artist_latitude": null,
  "artist_longitude": null,
  "artist_location": "",
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
  "duration": 152.92036,
  "year": 0
}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the
dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths
to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Redshift cluster data structure

### Fact table

**songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

```
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
```

### Dimension tables

**users** - users in the app

```
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
```

**songs** - songs in music database

```
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
```

**artists** - artists in music database

```
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
```

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

```
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
```

### Stage tables

**staging_events** - stage table for log data

```
artist, auth, firstName, gender, itemInSession, lastName, length, level, location, method, page, registration, sessionId, song, status, ts, userAgent, userId
```

**staging_songs** - stage table for song data

```
num_songs, artist_id, artist_latitude, artist_longitude, artist_location, artist_Name, song_id, title, duration, year
```

## Project files

`create_table.py` Recreates your fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift

`etl.py` - Loads data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then processes that data into your analytics tables on
Redshift

`sql_queries.py` - Query definitions for table object creation, table object deletion and SQL ETL

`dwh.exmaple.cfg` - Example configuration for ETL job

`manage_cluster.py` - Crude infrastructure as code to create a redshift cluster and expose it publicly

`manage_cluster.exmaple.cfg` - Example configuration for IAC (Infrastructure as code, `manage_cluster.py`) script

## How to run

1. Rename/Create the configuration files with proper name
    ```shell
    cp dwh.exmaple.cfg dwh.cfg
    cp manage_cluster.exmaple.cfg manage_cluster.cfg
    ```
1. Create, activate virtual env, install necessary python packages
   ```shell
   python3 -m pip install virtualenv
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate 
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
1. (Optional) Update the configuration in `manage_cluster.cfg` file
1. (Optional) Create cluster by running following
   ```shell
   python manage_cluster.py create --wait 
   ```
1. Update the configuration in `dwh.cfg` file
1. Create the redshift table objects
   ```shell
   python create_tables.py
   ```
1. Run the ETL job
   ```shell
   python etl.py
   ```   
1. (Optional) Remove Redshift cluster
   ```
   python manage_cluster.py delete --wait
   ```

## Star schema data retrieval

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM
    songplays    sp
    JOIN artists a ON a.artist_id = sp.artist_id
    JOIN songs   s ON s.song_id = sp.song_id
    JOIN "time"  t ON t.start_time = sp.start_time
    JOIN users   u ON u.user_id = sp.user_id
```
